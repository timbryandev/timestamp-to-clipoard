# timestamp-to-clipoard

This tool consists of a batch file that when run, will grab the current date and time and add it to the clipboard. The datetime takes the form of `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS`, for example 11:45:19 on the 6th October 2020 will become `2020-10-06_11-45-19`

The main use case for this tool came about when I needed to add timestamps to filenames on a cached server for testing purposes, and also for some very crude version control of files and projects in .zip's where many copies and backups were being created and order needed to be preserved.
